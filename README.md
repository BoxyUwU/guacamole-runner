[Guacamole Runner](https://github.com/EllenNyan/guacamole-runner) is a small game made with [Tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/Tetra) and [Shipyard](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard) in approximately 2 days by [@EllenNyan](https://twitter.com/EllenNyan0214).  
The game's concept is that the player is constantly falling 
and must jump off planes to stay in the air. 
When they go over the top of the dirt tiles 
they plant flowers which gives them points.
