[Guacamole Runner](https://github.com/EllenNyan/guacamole-runner) is a small game made with [Tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/Tetra) and [Shipyard](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard) in approximately 2 days by [@EllenNyan](https://twitter.com/EllenNyan0214).  
The game's concept is that you're constantly falling and must jump off planes constantly to stay in the air. When you go over the top of the dirt tiles, you plant flowers which gives you points.
